Her breath stank of garlic.
It stinks of smoke in here.
Don't go in thereâ€”it stinks.
It stinks in here!
 His breath stank of alcohol.
 The toilets stank to high heaven.
  Her room is filthy, and it stinks.
The fish lay in a plastic basin in the kitchen, spoiled and stinking.
How can you eat that cheese, it stinks.
Your shoes stink.
The streets stink and run with mud and excrement.
His clothes stank of cigarette smoke.
The woman stank of neglect.
You boys stink to high heaven - go inside and take a shower.
