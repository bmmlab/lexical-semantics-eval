The flags were flapping in the breeze.
 Flap your arms to keep warm.
 The bird flapped its wings and flew away.
The gulls flew off, wings flapping.
She walked up and down, flapping her arms to keep warm.
A gust of wind flapped the tents.
The sails flapped in the breeze.
Her wet skirt flapped around her knees.
His coat flapped open.
The man was flapping a large white sheet.
