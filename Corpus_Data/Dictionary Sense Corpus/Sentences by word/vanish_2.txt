All thoughts of leaving vanished from his mind.
Her feelings of shyness rapidly vanished.
Many of these old cinemas have now vanished altogether.
Much of the land we loved has vanished forever.
The people who built this temple have long since vanished.
This plant is vanishing from our countryside.
a way of life that has now all but vanished
The canal crosses the site of an ancient lake, long since vanished.
