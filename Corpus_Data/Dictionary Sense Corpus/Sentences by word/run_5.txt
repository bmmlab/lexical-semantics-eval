The tears ran down her cheeks.
Water was running all over the bathroom floor.
She ran hot water into the bucket.
To run the hot tap.
I'll run a bath for you.
I'll run you a bath.
Who left the tap running?
Your nose is running.
The smoke makes my eyes run.
His face was running with sweat.
The bathroom floor was running with water.
The colour ran and made all my underwear pink.
The wax began to run.
Tears started to run down her cheeks.
 Water was running off the roof.
  Did you leave the tap running?
 He ran the tap until the water was really hot.
