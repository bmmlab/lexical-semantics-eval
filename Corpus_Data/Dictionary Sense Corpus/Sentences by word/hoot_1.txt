He had the audience hooting with laughter.
Some people hooted in disgust.
The crowd hooted and cheered.
His friends all hooted with laughter.
 Passing motorists hooted their horns.
The train hooted a warning
The car behind me hooted impatiently.
 Cars and lorries hooting, accelerating and braking put Dawn into a real flap.
Chutra hooted, bared his teeth, scratched his ribs.
A horn hooted behind me. It was Don in his little red car.
Truck drivers hooted, children stared, and just about everyone laughed or waved.
Beyond, the post van hooted indignantly.
That evening was filled with the sound of hooting owls.
Chick started hooting the Cortina's horn impatiently.
Ships hooted their horns as the flag went up.
Two hours later I was woken by men whistling, clicking, trilling and hooting their music to the flocks.
There is too much noise in here to speak: stamping, hooting, whistling.
He had the audience hooting with laughter.
