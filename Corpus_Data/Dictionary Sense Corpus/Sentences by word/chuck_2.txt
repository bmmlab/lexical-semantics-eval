I think I might have chucked it by mistake.
Just go ahead and chuck out the batteries.
And chuck that bulk-paid glossy stuff in the trash before you put the key in the door.
That's no goodâ€”just chuck it.
I took a great dislike to the clock, so I chucked it in the dustbin.
I'll chuck away the kitchen scales and use my palms from now on.
It's true that the amount of non-degradable junk we chuck away is a scandal.
