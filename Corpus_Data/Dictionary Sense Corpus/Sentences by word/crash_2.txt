Thunder crashed and boomed outside.
The cymbals crashed, and the symphony came to an end.
The tree fell with a great crash.
The first distant crash of thunder shook the air.
She heard the crash of shattering glass as the vehicles collided.
The bike hit the street and made a loud crash.
The plates fell to the floor with an almighty crash.
There was a sickening crash as her head hit the ground.
The crash of the waves on the rocks.
