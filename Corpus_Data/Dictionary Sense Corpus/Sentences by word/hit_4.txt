 The idea hit me like a tornado.
I couldn't remember where I'd seen him before, and then it suddenly hit me.
That's when it really hit me that we were in deep trouble.
Itâ€™s impossible to pinpoint a moment when it hit me.
He was gone before they knew what had hit them.
It hit me that I had a choice.
Then the answer hit me.
