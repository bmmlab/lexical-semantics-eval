I sank into an armchair.
She sank back into her seat, exhausted.
The old man had sunk to his knees.
He sank lower into his chair.
I sank gratefully into the warm, dry bed.
She sank gracefully down onto a cushion at his feet.
She sank to the ground, exhausted.
The sun was sinking in the west.
The sun had sunk below the horizon.
The foundations of the building are starting to sink.
She let out a groan and sank into a chair.
 He let go of her shoulders and she sank at once to the floor.
 Marion sank down on a rock, and wept.
 The minister sank to his knees.
  The sun was sinking behind the coconut palms.
 Her chin sank onto her chest, and she looked despairing.
 As the sun sank lower and lower, the sky first turned pink and then orange.
  His heart sank the way it always did when she left him.
