By now the rain was pelting down.
I drove home with the rain pelting through the window.
Raindrops the size of golf balls were pelting down on her.
Rain pelted the windows.
 Itâ€™s pelting down out there.
 The cold wind and pelting rain.
  I watched as the sky curdled and darkened and the rain pelted the road with silvery stones.
