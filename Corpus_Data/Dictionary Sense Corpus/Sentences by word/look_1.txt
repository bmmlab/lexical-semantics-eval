 If you look carefully you can see that the painting represents a human figure.
 Gina covered her eyes, afraid to look.
 The men all turned to look at her as she entered the room.
 Dad looked up from his paper and smiled.
He was looking down the road to see if the bus was coming.
He looked longingly at the food on the table.
He turned to look as she came down the stairs.

She looked towards the door.

If you look carefully you can just see our house from here.
Don't look now, but there's someone staring at you!
 She looked at me and smiled.
I got up and looked out of the window.
She looked across to the other side of the room.
