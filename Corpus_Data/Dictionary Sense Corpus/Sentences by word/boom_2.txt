A crash of thunder boomed so loudly that the floor shook.
Guns boomed in the distance.
'Ladies and gentlemen,' his voice boomed out.
Loud music boomed from the public-address system.
A crash of thunder boomed so loudly that the floor shook.
The ship's gun boomed and the shot fell only a hundred metres away.
A voice boomed out from the darkness.
A voice from the loudspeaker boomed out, â€˜Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
'Ladies,' boomed Helena, without a microphone, 'we all know why we're here tonight.'
Thunder boomed like battlefield cannons over Crooked Mountain.
A megaphone boomed out, 'This is the police.'
