He flung his coat over the back of a chair.
 She flung back the covers and got up.
 He flung the books aside angrily
 He flung the box into the river.
 People cheered and flung their hats into the air.
 He flung himself down on the bed.
 She flung her arms round Louise.
 He grabbed her arm and flung her to the ground.
 She flung herself into her room and began to pack frantically.
She flung the letter down onto the table.
We flung him the safety rope.
Someone had flung a brick through the window.
He flung her to the ground.
I was flung forward by the impact.
I flung a few clothes into a bag.
He had his enemies flung into prison.
She flung herself onto the bed.
He flung out an arm to stop her from falling.
