I looked up at the clouds floating in the sky.
 Leaves floated gently down from the trees.
 The sound of her voice came floating down from an upstairs window.
 A few small clouds floated across the sky.
Her voice seemed to float on the water as gently as a slight mist.
In the dream my feet leave the ground and I start to float upwards.
