The rocket soared up into the air.
Her spirits soared.
The plane was soon soaring up into the sky.
The ball went soaring past my head.
She stopped suddenly and her bag went soaring through the air.
She watched the dove soar above the chestnut trees.
The ball soared to left field.
The space shuttle soared into orbit.
An eagle soared above us.
