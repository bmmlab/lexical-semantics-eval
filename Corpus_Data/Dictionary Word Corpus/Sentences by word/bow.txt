He bowed low to the assembled crowd.
The people all bowed down before the emperor.
He swept off his hat and bowed deeply to the queen.
The emperor's subjects bowed down before him.
The pianist stood up and bowed to the audience.
She bowed her head in shame.
They stood in silence with their heads bowed.
The pines bowed in the wind.
Their backs were bowed under the weight of their packs.
She was beginning to tire of all their bowing and scraping.
