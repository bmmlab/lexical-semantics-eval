Someone had flung a brick through the window.
He flung her to the ground.
I was flung forward by the impact.
I flung a few clothes into a bag.
He had his enemies flung into prison.
The door was suddenly flung open.
Some kids were throwing stones at the window.
She threw the ball and he caught it.
She tossed her jacket onto the bed.
Rioters hurled a brick through the car’s windscreen.
She flung the letter down onto the table.
I chucked him the keys.
They were lobbing stones over the wall.
She flung the letter down onto the table.
‘Hey, catch!’ she said, flinging him a towel.
She flung herself onto the bed.
He flung out an arm to stop her from falling.
They were flinging insults at each other.
