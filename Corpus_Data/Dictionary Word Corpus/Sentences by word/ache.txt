I'm aching all over.
Her eyes ached from lack of sleep.
It makes my heart ache (= it makes me sad) to see her suffer.
My feet hurt.
Ouch! That hurt!
Iâ€™m aching all over.
Our eyes were burning from the chemicals in the air.
My eyes were stinging from the smoke.
The cold air made her face tingle.
I itch all over.
Does the rash itch?
His head throbbed painfully.
I was aching for home.
He ached to see her.
