She was humming softly to herself.
He began to hum along with the music.
What's that tune you're humming?
He began to hum, somewhat tunelessly.
I was humming along with the music.
The computers were humming away.
The overhead wires hummed with power.
The streets were beginning to hum with life.
The whole room was humming now.
Things were beginning to hum.
We hummed and hawed for weeks before deciding to buy the house.
