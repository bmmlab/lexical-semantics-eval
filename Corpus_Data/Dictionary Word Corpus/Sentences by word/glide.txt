Swans went gliding past.
The skaters were gliding over the ice.
a swan gliding serenely past
Boats were gliding gracefully on the lake.
The ball glided into the back of the net.
The blade glided easily over my skin.
The dancers glided smoothly across the floor.
An eagle was gliding high overhead.
The plane managed to glide down to the runway.
The swan spread its wings and glided gently downward.
He cut the engines and glided silently into the clearing.
