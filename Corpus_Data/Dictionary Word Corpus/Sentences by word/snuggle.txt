The child snuggled up to her mother.
He snuggled down under the bedclothes.
She snuggled closer.
He snuggled his head onto her shoulder.
He snuggled back under the covers.
She slipped her arm through his and snuggled close.
She snuggled into her sleeping bag and closed her eyes.
We snuggled up together on the couch.
