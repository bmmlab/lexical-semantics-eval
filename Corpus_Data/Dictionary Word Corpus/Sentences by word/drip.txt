She was hot and sweat dripped into her eyes.
Water was dripping down the walls.
The rain came down and dripped off the edges of the car.
The tap was dripping.
Her hair dripped down her back.
Her hands were dripping with blood.
Be careful, you're dripping paint everywhere!
The trees were dripping with fruit.
His voice dripped sarcasm.
