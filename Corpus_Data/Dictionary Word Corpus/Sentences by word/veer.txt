The bus veered onto the wrong side of the road.
It is still not clear why the missile veered off course.
He veered left towards them.
The car veered off the road.
The missile veered wildly off course.
The path veers sharply to the right.
The plane veered away to the left.
The ship veered round wildly in the rough sea.
The debate veered away from the main topic of discussion.
His emotions veered between fear and anger.
The play veers from loopy comedy to serious moralizing.
His poetry veered dangerously close to sentimentalism.
He veered between the extremes of optimism and pessimism.
The wind veered to the west.
