Through clenched teeth she told him to leave.
His fists clenched slowly until his knuckles were white.

His jaw was clenched tight.
Her pen was clenched between her teeth.
She had a gun clenched tightly in her hand.
He clenched the steering wheel tightly.
She sat at her desk, her pen clenched between her teeth.
He had a wine glass clenched firmly in his hand.
