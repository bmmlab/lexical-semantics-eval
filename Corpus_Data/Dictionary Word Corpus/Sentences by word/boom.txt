Loud music boomed from the public-address system.
A crash of thunder boomed so loudly that the floor shook.
The ship's gun boomed and the shot fell only a hundred metres away.
‘Get out of my sight!’ he boomed.
A voice boomed out from the darkness.
A voice from the loudspeaker boomed out, ‘Good evening, ladies and gentlemen’.
He had a booming voice.
By the 1980s, the computer industry was booming.
Business is booming!
The club scene was booming.
Tourist numbers have boomed in recent years.
