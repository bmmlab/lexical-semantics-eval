The bigger girls used to chase me and tickle me.
I tickled his feet with a feather.
Stop tickling!
His beard was tickling her cheek.
My throat tickles.
a tickling cough
to tickle somebody’s imagination
I was tickled to discover that we'd both done the same thing.
She was tickled pink to be given flowers.
See if any of these tickle your fancy.
If you see something that tickles your fancy, I’ll buy it for you.
