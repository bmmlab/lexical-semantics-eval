Our baby is just starting to crawl.
A man was crawling away from the burning wreckage.
She crawled under the fence.
As night fell, we managed to crawl back to our lines.
Has the baby started to crawl yet?
We spent an hour crawling around on our hands and knees looking for the key.
She was forced to crawl along through the thickening mist.
There's a spider crawling up your leg.
The traffic was crawling along.
The weeks crawled by.
The traffic was crawling as I left the city.
The taxi crawled to a halt.
She's always crawling to the boss.
When he won the lottery, all sorts of distant relatives came out of the woodwork.
Just the sight of him makes my skin crawl.
