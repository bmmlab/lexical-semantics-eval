Bees buzzed lazily among the flowers.
The doorbell buzzed loudly.
My ears were buzzing (= were filled with a continuous sound).
A large helicopter buzzed overhead.
A police helicopter was buzzing overhead.
New York buzzes from dawn to dusk.
My head was still buzzing after the day's events.
The place was buzzing with journalists.
The doctor buzzed for the next patient to come in.
