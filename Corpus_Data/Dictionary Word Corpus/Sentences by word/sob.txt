I heard a child sobbing loudly.
He started to sob uncontrollably.
She began sobbing into her pillow.
He was pleading, almost sobbing, first silently and then aloud.
She was sobbing with pain and fear.
‘I hate him,’ she sobbed.
He sobbed out his troubles.
She flung herself at his chest and sobbed her heart out.
