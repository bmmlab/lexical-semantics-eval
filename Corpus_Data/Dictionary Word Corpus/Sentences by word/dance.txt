Do you want to dance?
He asked me to dance.
They stayed up all night singing and dancing.
They danced to the music of a string quartet.
Ruth danced all evening with Richard.
Ruth and Richard danced together all evening.
They danced wildly down the street.
We danced to the music.
Will you dance with me?
to dance the tango
to dance a waltz
He was so excited about the good news that he danced a little jig.
The children danced around her.
He was almost dancing for joy.
The sun shone on the sea and the waves danced and sparkled.
The words danced before her tired eyes.
