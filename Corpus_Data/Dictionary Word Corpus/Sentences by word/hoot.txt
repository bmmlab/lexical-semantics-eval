He had the audience hooting with laughter.
Some people hooted in disgust.
The crowd hooted and cheered.
His friends all hooted with laughter.
The car behind me hooted impatiently.
Why did he hoot at me?
Passing motorists hooted their horns.
The train hooted a warning (= the driver sounded the horn to warn people).
