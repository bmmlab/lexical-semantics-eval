The snake slithered away as we approached.
Zack slithered along on his belly.
She slithered into the water like a crocodile.
We slithered down the slope to the road.
They were slithering around on the ice.
Her knees gave way and she slithered to the floor.
The horses slipped and slithered in the mud.
