Don't you know it's rude to whisper?
What are you two whispering about?
‘Can you meet me tonight?’ he whispered.
'I'm sorry,' he whispered softly.
‘Let's go,' she whispered to Anne.
She leaned over and whispered something in his ear.
I whispered words of comfort to him.
He whispered to me that he was afraid.
She whispered that she would tell me all about it later.
‘Come on,’ he whispered urgently.
‘Hush!’ he whispered against her hair.
‘No!’ he whispered through gritted teeth.
‘Yes, ’ I whispered back.
He could only whisper in reply.
He held her and whispered sweet nothings in her ear.
I felt that everyone was whispering about me.
She heard him whisper her name.
It was whispered that he would soon die and he did.
A warm breeze whispered through the trees.
